# Explore-Hub
This project focuses on developing an intelligent route planning application using graph data structures, where locations are nodes, and routes are edges. Advanced algorithms like ACO, A*, and Beam Search will compute optimal paths between destinations efficiently.
Explore Hub is an intelligent route-planning application designed to optimize travel by computing the best routes between destinations. Leveraging advanced graph algorithms, the system ensures efficient travel while considering user preferences, time, and cost. It is tailored for individual travelers, logistics companies, and urban planners.
